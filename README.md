## Overview

Nellavio is a free, open-source dashboard starter designed for building modern SaaS products, internal tools and data-rich admin panels. It provides the UI components, pages and patterns you need to create a complete dashboard application - available out of the box.

It will give you a solid head start and save a lot of development time by serving as a practical foundation that you can easily extend and adapt to your specific needs. The project runs as a standalone frontend by default, ready to be integrated with your own API or an optional Nellavio backend that enables a production-ready authentication flow.

## Quickstart

You can get started with Nellavio by cloning the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nellavio/nellavio.git
cd nellavio
npm install
npm run dev
```

🎉 **That's it!** Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to explore the dashboard.

Nellavio starter is designed to work as a standalone front-end application by default. It loads mock data from `public/backendBackup.json` and has routes protection disabled.

Optionally, it can be connected to an associated Node.js backend, which enables authentication and fetching real data on each request. See `Configuration` section below for more details.

## Configuration (optional)

### Connect to backend & enable authentication

Want to use real backend and authentication? Follow these steps:

#### 1. Set up the backend

Clone and run the [Nellavio Backend](https://github.com/nellavio/nellavio-backend)

Follow the instructions in the backend README to initialize and seed the database. The backend will run on `http://localhost:4000` by default.

#### 2. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```env
# Backend GraphQL API
GRAPHQL_URL=http://localhost:4000/graphql

# Better Auth Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:4000/api/auth
```

#### 3. Restart the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

That's it! The dashboard will automatically:

- ✅ Connect to your backend for real data
- ✅ Enable route protection
- ✅ Allow user registration and login
- ✅ Switch RBAC user management from demo to real users

### How it works

The application automatically detects your configuration:

**Standalone mode** (no env vars)

- Uses mock data from `backendBackup.json`, all routes accessible without login
- User Management page shows demo users with interactive role assignment, role filter, sorting and pagination (resets on refresh)
- `npm run build` pre-renders pages as static HTML, `npm start` serves them instantly

**Backend online** (env vars set, backend running)

- Fetches real data from GraphQL backend, route protection is enabled
- User Management page fetches real users via Better Auth admin API with persistent role assignment
- `npm run build` and `npm start` treat pages as dynamic, fetching fresh data on each request

**Backend offline** (env vars set, backend unreachable)

- Route protection enabled, but login is not possible while the backend is down
- Same build and runtime behavior as `Backend online` mode, but pages will fail to load data

> Note: `npm run dev` always tries to render pages dynamically regardless of the configuration

If you use `npm start` (production mode), please remember that `npm run build` must be run after configuring environment variables for changes to take effect. This is not needed when using `npm run dev`.

### RBAC implementation

Three roles are defined in `src/config/access.ts`: **admin**, **editor** and **viewer**. Out of the box, role-based access is enforced on the User Management page - only admins can access it, non-admin users see an "Access Denied" screen, and self-demotion triggers an automatic sign-out.

The `useUserManagement` hook detects the current mode and switches data source accordingly - in standalone mode it reads from a Zustand store (`rbacStore`) with mock users and in-memory role assignment (resets on refresh), while with the backend connected it calls Better Auth admin endpoints (`/admin/list-users`, `/admin/set-role`) with cookie-based authentication. Per-resource permissions (view/edit on orders, customers, products) are defined in the backend `access.ts` and can be used to restrict additional pages or features as needed - see `How to customize` section below.

### One-click deploy

For remote hosting, you can easily deploy your own instance of Nellavio dashboard on Vercel using the link below.

## How to customize

#### Add a new page

1. Create a folder in `src/app/[locale]/(protected)/` with a `page.tsx` file
2. Add an entry to `src/config/navigationConfig.ts` to show it in the sidebar
3. Wrap your content with `<PageWrapper pageName="YourPage">` for breadcrumbs and layout

#### Add a new color token

1. Add the CSS variable to both `src/styles/themes/light.css` and `dark.css`
2. For consistency, consider placing it in one of the existing groups (Texts, Icons, Backgrounds or Borders) following the naming convention
3. Tailwind 4 auto-generates utility classes from the `--color-` prefix - use `bg-yourToken`, `text-yourToken` etc.

#### Add a new language

1. Create a new JSON file in `messages/` (e.g. `de.json`) based on `en.json`
2. Add the locale to `src/i18n/routing.ts` in the `locales` array
3. Add a language option in `UserMenuDropdown.tsx`

#### Set up the first admin

New users are assigned the `viewer` role by default. To grant admin access after connecting the backend:

1. Register a user account through the frontend
2. Open Prisma Studio (`npx prisma studio`) or run SQL directly
3. Set `role` to `admin` for your user: `UPDATE "user" SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'your@email.com'`
4. Sign out and sign back in to refresh your session

Once you have an admin, you can manage other users' roles directly from the `/user-management` page.

#### Restrict a page by role

Out of the box, only the User Management page is restricted to admins. To add role-based access to another page:

1. Use `useSession()` from `src/services/auth/auth-client.ts` to get the current user's role
2. Check `session.data?.user?.role` and render an access denied screen or redirect if the role doesn't match
3. For backend enforcement, check `context.session.user.role` in the GraphQL resolver or add a permission check using the roles defined in `src/access.ts` on the backend side

#### Change default settings

Edit `src/config/appDefaults.ts` to change the default theme, font, sidebar state, chart animations, toast duration and other global defaults. These values are used by Zustand stores on first visit.

## Accessibility

- Keyboard navigation with Tab and arrow buttons across all interactive elements
- Visible focus indicators (focus-visible) with single CSS variable for consistent outline color
- ARIA attributes wherever needed across components
- UI components are built on top of Radix UI primitives which provide core accessibility support
- Tested with Storybook a11y addon and Chrome Lighthouse (95+)

### Keyboard shortcuts

Desktop-only shortcuts (active above 1280px). Disabled when focus is inside a text input (except `Ctrl+K`).

| Shortcut   | Action         |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| `Ctrl + K` | Focus search   |
| `Ctrl + \` | Toggle sidebar |
| `Ctrl + /` | Toggle theme   |

On macOS use `Cmd` instead of `Ctrl`.
